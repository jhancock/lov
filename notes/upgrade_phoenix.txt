notes on upgrdaing phoenix

create a new phoenix project on mac and use Beyond Compare to work through mods
add changes into a git branch

after the manual compare/mods push the branch to daai server and test

on daai server be sure to run:
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
cd assets
npm update # this will modify assets/package.json 
npm audit fix
