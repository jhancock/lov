create a new phoenix project on mac and use Beyond Compare to work through mods
add changes into a git branch

after the manual compare/mods push the branch to daai server and test

on daai server be sure to run:
mix deps.get
# cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
cd assets && npm install 
cd assets
npm install # install whats in packages.json
# npm update # this will try to install/update to latest version; modify assets/package.json
