https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/e53e79ef8b34adf5d8122a47db44d22f

$ mix archive.uninstall phx_new
$ mix archive.install hex phx_new 1.5.0-rc.0


create a new phoenix project on mac and use Beyond Compare to work through mods
add changes into a git branch

after the manual compare/mods push the branch to ai server and test

on ai server be sure to run:
mix deps.get
# cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
cd assets && npm install 
# npm update # this will try to update to latest versions, not always what we want; modify assets/package.json 
# npm audit fix
